# pvp2048
pvp2048(name is temporary) is a 1vs1 turn based multiplayer game based on 2048.

## Gameplay
Game is basiclly 2048 but when one player did the swipe second player gets a turn.
Each player has his own score and player get points for merge only on their turn.
Player who has most points when a game ends wins.
Control the game by pressing arrow keys and maybe add some mouse only option like dragging or buttons.

## Social interactions
Either guest mode or very basic registration.
There should be ability to play with friends and that means game invites(but friend list is probably overkill)
Game should have matchmaking based on players elo.
chat with opponent(maybe dms?)
Maybe add some divisions on top of elo in ranked to create goal to reach for players.

## Some questions
Not sure why i made this section but i did.
- Does player who does first turn have advantage?
- Should game spwan tiles completly random or have some sort of pattern?(its could be useful to discourage some behaivor or to make game more skill-based or to implemet comeback mechanic)
